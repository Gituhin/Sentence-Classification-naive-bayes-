science,"He estimates that 1,000-micrometer pellets could survive eight years floating through space."
science,"“That’s enough time to potentially get to Mars,” he says. Rare meteors might even be able to travel between Mars and Earth in a few months or years."
science,"How exactly clumps of microbes might get expelled into space is not clear. But such a trip could happen, he says."
science,"The microbes might get kicked up by small meteorites. Or they might be thrown from Earth into space by thunderstorm-induced perturbations to Earth’s magnetic field, Yamagishi says."
science,"Someday, if microbial life is ever discovered on Mars, he hopes to look for evidence of such a journey. “That’s my ultimate dream.”"
sports,"In tennis, After the service has been correctly returned, the players may volley the ball (i.e., hit it before it bounces) or hit it after its first bounce, and the point continues until one player fails to make a correct return."
sports,"This may occur if a tennis player fails to hit the ball over the net, hits it outside the opponent’s boundaries, or fails to hit it before it strikes the ground a second time on his or her side of the net."
sports,"To win a game, a tennis player must win four points and by a margin of two. The scoring goes 15, 30, 40, game; this system, derived from real tennis, is medieval in origin."
sports,"In tennis, It never has been satisfactorily explained why three points equal 40 rather than 45. Zero is generally referred to as “love,” which is thought to be derived from l’oeuf, the French word for “egg.” "
sports,"In tennis, The server’s score is called first; thus, 30–15 means that the server has two points to one, whereas 15–30 means that the receiver has two points to one."
business,"Herb Kelleher makes it clear that his employees come first — even if it means dismissing customers. But aren’t customers always right? “No, they are not,” Kelleher snaps. And I think that’s one of the biggest betrayals of employees a boss can possibly commit. The customer is sometimes wrong."
business,"We don’t carry those sorts of customers. We write to them and say, ‘Fly somebody else. Don’t abuse our people.’"
business,A Continental flight attendant once was offended by a passenger’s child wearing a hat with Nazi and KKK emblems on it.
business,"It was pretty offensive stuff, so the attendant went to the kid’s father and asked him to put away the hat. “No,” the guy said. “My kid can wear what he wants, and I don’t care who likes it.”"

covid,"However, as of April 2020, over 210 countries and territories are affected by the virus, with Europe, the USA, and Iran forming the new cluster of the virus. "
covid,"Similarly, SARS and MERS were also suspected to originate from bats. In the case of MERS, the dromedary camel is an intermediate host."
covid,"Bats have been known to harbor coronaviruses for quite some time now. Just as in the case of avian flu, SARS, MERS, and possibly even HIV, with increasing selection and ecological pressure due to human activities, the virus made the jump from animal to man."
covid,The identification of the original host helps us to contain future spreads as well as to learn about the mechanism of transmission of viruses.
