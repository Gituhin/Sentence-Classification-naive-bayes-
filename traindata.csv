science,Any life-forms that somehow find themselves in the void soon die. Unless they band together.,,,,
science,"As small communities, new research shows, some bacteria can withstand that harsh environment.",,,,
science,Balls of Deinococcus bacteria as thin as five sheets of paper were placed on the outside of the International Space Station.,,,,
science,They stayed there for three years. Microbes in the heart of those balls survived.,,,,
science,The group’s outer layers had shielded them from the extremes of space.,,,,
science,"It was known that microbes could survive inside artificial meteorites. But this is the first evidence microbes can survive this long unprotected, says Margaret Cramm.",,,,
science,"“It suggests life can survive on its own in space as a group,” she says.",,,,
science,Cramm is a microbiologist at the University of Calgary in Canada who did not take part in the study.,,,,
science,She says the new finding adds weight to the worry that human space travel could accidentally introduce life to other planets.,,,,
science,"Akihiko Yamagishi is an astrobiologist. He works at the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science in Tokyo, Japan.",,,,

science,"These radiation-resistant microbes thrive in extreme places, such as Earth’s stratosphere.",,,,
science,The bacteria were stuffed into small wells in metal plates. NASA astronaut Scott Kelly affixed those plates to the exterior of the space station. Samples were then sent back to Earth each year. ,,,,
science,"Back home, researchers moistened the pellets. They also fed the bacteria food. Then they waited.",,,,
science,"After three years in space, bacteria in 100-micrometer-thick pellets didn’t make it.",,,,
science,DNA studies suggested that radiation had fried their genetic material.,,,,
science,"The outer layers of pellets that were 500- to 1,000-micrometers (0.02 to 0.04 inch) thick also were dead.",,,,

business,"Of course, there are plenty of examples of bad employees giving lousy customer service but trying to solve this by declaring the customer “always right” is counter-productive.",,,,
business,"Using the slogan “The customer is always right,” abusive customers can demand just about anything — they’re right by definition, aren’t they? This makes the employees’ jobs that much harder when trying to rein them in.",,,,
business,"Also, it means that abusive people get better treatment and conditions than nice people. That always seemed wrong to me, and it makes much more sense to be nice to the nice customers to keep them coming back.",,,,

business,"Just like Kelleher dismissed the irate lady who kept complaining (but somehow also kept flying on Southwest), ServiceGruppen fired a bad customer.",,,,
